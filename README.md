# 2D-SideScrol

## Elevator Pitch
Simple video games always send me back to childhood. Many popular games today emphasize complexity and realism, but some of the games that provided me with the most enjoyment were quite simple. As an homage to those earlier, albeit not the earliest, generations of video games, this will be a side-scrolling game of survival. Emulating classics that graced early consoles and machines running the likes of Windows 95, users will play a character collecting some nondescript form of currency and avoiding the bad guys. 

## Tech Stack
+ HTML/CSS using Flexbox and Grid
+ Potentially Bootstrap elements for status bar
+ Javascript for object manipulation
+ Canvas for game screen render and collision detection

## MVP Goals
+ Start screen with understandable instructions
+ User controllable character via arrow keys (in all directions for mvp)
+ NPC movement (right to left in varying speeds for mvp, requiring user to maneuver around them as they collect coins)
+ Timer/Scoretracker
+ End game conditions with collision detection (game ends if PC collides with NPC)
+ Reset capability

## Stretch Goals
+ Default map movement
+ Variance in NPC movement 
+ Health Bar
+ Character jump/gravity
+ Environmental obstacles
+ Dynamic background

### Potential Roadblocks
+ Unfamiliar with animations or moving object styling
+ Unversed in technical aspects of visual design
